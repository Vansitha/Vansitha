# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vansitha, my skills include:
- Sitting at the desk for 10 hours straight.
- Reading the docs and writing unit tests.
- Debugging code (that I write) for 15 hours straight and feeling happy about it once I figure it out.

Well, jokes aside, if you're looking for someone to collaborate with to bring an idea to life, I'm all up for it. Feel free to drop a text.
