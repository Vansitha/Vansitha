# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vansitha, facts/skills about me:
- Sitting at the desk for 10 hours straight.
- Reading the docs and writing unit tests.
- Debugging code for 15 hours straight and feeling happy about it once I figure it out.
- Likes to type on a mechanical keyboard all day everyday.
- Can't code without vim motions. 

Well, jokes aside, if you're looking for someone to collaborate with to bring an idea to life, I'm all up for it. Feel free to drop a text.
