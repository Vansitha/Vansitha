# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vansitha, my skills include:
- Sitting at the desk for 10 hours straight.
- Reading the docs and writing unit tests.
- Debugging code (that I wrote) for 15 hours straight and feeling happy about it once I figure it out.

Well jokes aside, I'm looking forward for colaborting with you to bring an idea to life.
